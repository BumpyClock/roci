# About
Roci is a minimal agent harness and library inspired by pi-agent. It provides shared core primitives for building your own agent loop and custom agents on top. The repo also includes a reference implementation used to validate and iterate on the library.

Roci is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use. The API is subject to change as I iterate on the design and implementation.
