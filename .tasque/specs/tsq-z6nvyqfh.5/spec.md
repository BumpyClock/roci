# Hook docs + deferred tree controls

## Scope
- Document compaction hook contract and cancel semantics
- Document cancellation signal usage
- Explicitly record that tree instruction/label override fields are deferred

## Acceptance
- docs updated in roci-core/agent docs
- deferred scope called out to prevent accidental implementation creep
