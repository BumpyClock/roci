# roci-agent Example

## Goal
Provide a runnable example showing tools + steering + follow-up usage with minimal boilerplate.

## Scope
- Create/extend example under `examples/`.
- Demonstrate:
  - agent initialization,
  - tool registration,
  - steering injection during run,
  - follow-up queueing after completion.
- Include short usage instructions.

## Files
- `examples/` (new or updated example file)
- `docs/` if example docs are linked from README/dev docs

## Acceptance Criteria
- Example compiles with `--features roci-agent`.
- Example behavior mirrors documented control flow.
- Example references real API names in this repo.
